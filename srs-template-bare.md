## Revision History

| Name | Date | Reason For Changes | Version |
|------|------|--------------------|---------|
|      |      |                    |         |

## 1. Introduction
<!-- overview of the SRS: purpose, scope, audience, and organization of the document; avoid detailed requirements -->

### 1.1 Document Purpose
<!-- why this SRS exists, its intended audiences, and how they'll use it; keep to 2–4 sentences and avoid implementation detail -->

### 1.2 Product Scope
<!-- the product (name/version), its primary purpose, key capabilities, and boundaries. keep brief and focus on the "what" and "why", not the "how" -->

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
<!-- glossary of domain terms, acronyms, and abbreviations; keep entries alphabetized -->

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
|      |            |
|      |            |

### 1.4 References
<!-- normative and informative external sources; include title, owner, version, date, location/URL, and whether it is normative or informative -->

### 1.5 Document Overview
<!-- document structure and conventions -->

## 2. Product Overview
<!-- background and context that shape the product's requirements -->

### 2.1 Product Perspective
<!-- context of the system: a new product, a replacement, or part of a family; note relationships to other systems -->

### 2.2 Product Functions
<!-- major functional areas or features the product provides in 5–10 concise bullets -->

### 2.3 Product Constraints
<!-- design and implementation constraints that affect the solution -->

### 2.4 User Characteristics
<!-- classes, roles, expertise, access levels, frequency of use, and accessibility or localization needs -->

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
<!-- assumptions about environment, third-party services, usage patterns, and other external factors; note potential impact/risk. -->

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements
<!-- map major requirements to subsystems, services, or releases/iterations -->

## 3. Requirements
<!-- identifiable, verifiable, testable requirements; avoid implementation details -->

### 3.1 External Interfaces
<!-- inputs/outputs (formats, protocols, timing, etc); reference interface schemas where available. -->

#### 3.1.1 User Interfaces
<!-- user interactions (UI elements, dialogs, flows); reference design/style guides -->

#### 3.1.2 Hardware Interfaces
<!-- interactions with physical devices (types, signals, etc) -->

#### 3.1.3 Software Interfaces
<!-- integrations with other systems (APIs, contracts, owner, etc) -->

### 3.2 Functions
<!-- externally observable behaviors organized by feature/use case -->

### 3.3 Quality of Service
<!-- measurable non-functional attributes section -->

#### 3.3.1 Performance
<!-- time (latency, throughput, etc.) and space (memory, storage, bandwidth, etc.) -->

#### 3.3.2 Security
<!-- protection of data, identities, and operations (transit/rest, auth, encryption, etc); safety, confidentiality, privacy, integrity, and availability -->

#### 3.3.3 Reliability
<!-- ability to consistently perform as specified (MTBF, redundancy/failover, caches, etc) -->

#### 3.3.4 Availability
<!-- readiness to deliver service (target SLAs, maintenance windows, recovery/restore, etc) -->

#### 3.3.5 Observability
<!--  logs, metrics, traces, alerting and dashboards -->

### 3.4 Compliance
<!-- laws, standards, contracts, or policies; cite the authority and verifiable criteria. -->

### 3.5 Design and Implementation
<!-- constraints and mandates on design, deployment, and maintenance section -->

#### 3.5.1 Installation
<!-- ensure software runs smoothly in its target environments (supported platforms, prerequisites, configuration, etc) -->

#### 3.5.2 Build and Delivery
<!-- controls for building and delivering (dependency management, automation, integrity/traceability, etc) -->

#### 3.5.3 Distribution
<!-- distributed deployments, data, and devices (topologies, replication/placement, etc) -->

#### 3.5.4 Maintainability
<!-- measurable attributes that make the software easier to modify, fix, and evolve (modularity, standards, documentation, observability, etc) -->

#### 3.5.5 Reusability
<!-- components intended for reuse -->

#### 3.5.6 Portability
<!-- ability to run on multiple environments (supported OSs/runtimes, cloud providers, etc) -->

#### 3.5.7 Cost
<!-- targets/budgets that influence design or implementation (cloud spend, per-transaction, licensing, etc) -->

#### 3.5.8 Deadline
<!-- milestones, delivery dates, and readiness criteria -->

#### 3.5.9 Proof of Concept
<!-- objectives, scope, timebox, and success criteria for any POC -->

#### 3.5.10 Change Management
<!-- how changes are introduced and communicated (categories, required artifacts and workflow, etc) -->

### 3.6 AI/ML
<!-- ML-specific requirements section -->

#### 3.6.1 Model Specification
<!-- model purpose, inputs/outputs, performance targets, validation data, versioning -->

#### 3.6.2 Data Management
<!-- lifecycle of datasets (origin, labeling, anonymization, etc) -->

#### 3.6.3 Guardrails
<!-- controls that the system operates within approved boundaries (validation/sanitation, output filtering, action limits, etc) -->

#### 3.6.4 Ethics
<!-- fairness, transparency, and accountability metrics/enforcement -->

#### 3.6.5 Human-in-the-Loop
<!-- human oversight (review points, escalations, feedback, etc) -->

#### 3.6.6 Model Lifecycle and Operations
<!-- deployment, monitoring, retraining, and retiring -->
