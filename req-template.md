## Statement
âž¥ Write a single, testable requirement statement that specifies observable behavior or conditions. Use clear and active language focused on "what" the system must do, not "how" it will be implemented.

The system shall...

ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- Use normative language (e.g., "shall") for mandatory requirements and avoid vague qualifiers like "reasonable" or "suitable."

## Rationale
ðŸ’¬ _Why the requirement exists â€” its value, intent, and the problem it addresses._

âž¥ Tie the requirement to business objectives, user needs, compliance obligations, or risk mitigation. Indicate key stakeholders and consequences of not meeting the requirement.

ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- Keep the rationale concise (one to three sentences) and avoid repeating the statement.
- Mention any assumptions/dependencies that affect the requirementâ€™s necessity.

## Acceptance Criteria
âž¥ List verifiable criteria that constitute success for the requirement. Specify observable outputs, numeric thresholds, timing constraints, and pass/fail conditions. Use bullet points or a short table for clarity, and reference specific test cases or data when available.

ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- Make each criterion independently verifiable and unambiguous; prefer criteria that can checked with a yes/no result.
- Use precise units, tolerances, and sample sizes for non-functional attributes (e.g., latency, throughput, accuracy).

## Verification Method
Test | Analysis | Inspection | Demonstration | Other

âž¥ Briefly describe the verification approach. For Tests, reference test procedure IDs or suites; for Analysis, state models and assumptions; for Inspection or Demonstration, describe artifacts or scenarios to be examined.

ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- If multiple methods apply, indicate primary and secondary methods and their triggers.

## More Information
âž¥ Provide supporting context, links, and references that help implementers and verifiers understand the requirement.

ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- Note any open issues, assumptions, or pending decisions that could affect the requirement.
