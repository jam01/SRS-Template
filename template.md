| Name | Date | Reason For Changes | Version |
|------|------|--------------------|---------|
|      |      |                    |         |
|      |      |                    |         |

## 1. Introduction
💬 _Provides an overview of the entire document and orients the reader to the system being specified._

➥ Summarize the SRS’s purpose, product scope, intended audience, and how the document is organized. Do not include detailed requirements here; reference the relevant sections instead.

### 1.1 Document Purpose
💬 _Clarifies why this SRS exists, what it contains, and who should use it._

➥ State the purpose of the SRS in 2–4 sentences. Name the primary audiences (e.g., product, engineering, QA, security, compliance, operations) and how they use it across planning, design, testing, and acceptance. Emphasize that this document defines what the system must do (requirements), not how it will be built. Reference related documents only when essential (e.g., vision/scope, architecture).

💡 Tips:
* Keep to 2–4 sentences; defer specifics to later sections. Emphasize that the SRS defines what the system must do, not how it will do it.
* Mention related documents (vision/scope, architecture, roadmap, contracts) if relevant.

### 1.2 Product Scope
💬 _Defines the software product’s purpose, boundaries, and relationship to business goals_.

➥ Identify the product by name and version/release. In 3–5 sentences, describe its primary purpose, key capabilities, and intended outcomes. Clearly list inclusions and exclusions when this SRS covers part of a larger system. Connect capabilities to business objectives and reference a separate vision/scope document if needed.

💡 Tips:
* Focus on the “what” and “why”; save the “how” for design sections.
* Include a simple diagram if it clarifies boundaries within a larger system.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
➥ Help readers understand specialized terms and notation by providing a glossary of domain terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used in the SRS.

💡 Tips:
- Include terms that impact interpretation of requirements (e.g., “user,” “tenant,” “near real-time”).
- Link to external glossaries or normative sources (standard, policy, or authoritative doc) when available.
- Keep entries alphabetized and consistent across the document set.

| Term | Definition                                                                                                                   |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| API  | Application Programming Interface - A set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software     |
| SRS  | Software Requirements Specification - A document that describes the intended purpose, requirements, and nature of a software |
| UI   | User Interface - The visual part of computer application through which a user interacts with a software                      |

### 1.4 References
💬 _Lists external sources that are normative or informative for this SRS._

➥ Cite standards, contracts, policies, interface specs, UX style guides, use-case docs, architectural decisions, or a vision/scope document. For each reference, include title, author/owner, version, date, and location/URL. Indicate whether each reference is normative (binding) or informative (guidance).

💡 Tips:
- Ensure referenced versions match what engineering and QA will use.
- Prefer stable links or repository paths over volatile URLs.

### 1.5 Document Overview
💬 _Brief guide to the structure of the SRS so readers can quickly find what they need._

➥ Summarize what each major section covers (Product Overview, Requirements, Verification, Appendixes) and note any conventions (requirement IDs, keywords like “shall/should/may”). Mention how updates and revision history are managed.

💡 Tips:
- Keep to 3–5 sentences focusing on navigation and conventions.

## 2. Product Overview
💬 _Provides background and context influencing the product’s requirements._

➥ Briefly describe the system’s broader context, major capabilities, constraints, users, assumptions, dependencies, and allocation of requirements across elements when relevant.

### 2.1 Product Perspective
💬 _Places the product within a larger ecosystem or lineage._

➥ Describe whether this is a new product, replacement, or member of a family. If part of a larger system, briefly explain relationships, external interfaces, and key dependencies. Provide a high-level context diagram or description of components and integrations to orient the reader.

💡 Tips:
- Keep diagrams and descriptions high-level and stable across versions.
- Highlight upstream/downstream systems and ownership boundaries.

### 2.2 Product Functions
💬 _High-level summary of what the product enables users or systems to do._

➥ Provide a concise overview of major functional areas/features. Defer detailed behaviors, data, and edge cases to Section 3.

💡 Tips:
- 5–10 bullets are often sufficient at this level, grouping related functions logically.
- Use wording consistent with feature names in roadmaps/backlogs.
- Include a top-level data flow or use case diagram if helpful.

### 2.3 Product Constraints
💬 _Defines limitations or conditions shaping design and implementation._

➥ Describe constraints such as mandated interfaces, technology stacks, regulatory obligations, QoS baselines, hardware limitations, AI/ML model families, and organizational policies.

💡 Tips:
- Distinguish external/internal and mandatory/preferred constraints.
- State constraints as verifiable statements (e.g., “must use FIPS 140–3 validated crypto modules”).
- Avoid embedding design decisions unless truly binding.

📝 Note: 
- Compliance Requirements (Section 3.4) states external obligations; this section translates them and other factors into concrete design/implementation constraints.

📋 Checklist:
- [ ] Is each constraint verifiable?
- [ ] Is the source (policy/decision) linked?
- [ ] Is it distinct from requirements and compliance?

### 2.4 User Characteristics
💬 _Defines the user groups and the attributes that affect requirements._

➥ Identify user classes, roles, and personas, noting expertise, access levels, frequency of use, accessibility needs, and goals. Explain which requirements apply to which user classes and which classes are primary versus secondary.

💡 Tips:
- Define user classes by behavior, not just titles.
- Note localization and accessibility considerations that affect UI/UX requirements.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
💬 _External assumed factors or conditions, as opposed to known facts, that the project relies on._

➥ List assumptions about environment, hardware, usage patterns, third-party components/services, and organizational support. List dependencies on external systems, libraries, or teams. For each, indicate potential impact if proven false.

💡 Tips:
- Treat assumptions as risks; link to risk register with owner and mitigation when available.
- Keep this section updated as decisions and implementation evolve.

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements
💬 _Allocation of requirements across components or increments._

➥ Map major requirements to subsystems, services, or releases/iterations. Use a cross-reference table to show allocation and to clearly identify deferred requirements.

💡 Tips:
- Align apportioning with project roadmaps.
- Note unknown allocations explicitly and track as follow-ups.

## 3. Requirements
💬 _This section specifies **verifiable** requirements of the software product to enable design and testing._

➥ State requirements to a level of detail sufficient for design and verification. Use unique identifiers, consistent keywords (shall/should/may), and clear conditions. Describe inputs, processing in response, and outputs where applicable.

📃 Template:
```text
Requirement Format
- ID: REQ-FUNC-001
- Statement: The system shall …
- Rationale: …
- Acceptance Criteria: …
- Verification Method: test | analysis | inspection | demo

#### 3.3.2 Security
💬 _Defines the protection of data, identities, and operations._

➥ Define authentication, authorization, data protection (in transit/at rest), auditing, and privacy requirements. Reference relevant policies/regulations (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR) and required certifications. Include secure defaults and incident response requirements where applicable. Address both abuse or misuse of authorized functionality and external attack attempts (e.g., injection, data exfiltration, or service compromise).

💡 Tips:
- State cryptographic standards and key management expectations.
- Distinguish between mandatory controls and best practices.
- Consider organizing into subcategories for clarity: Safety (harmful external outcomes), Confidentiality (disclose data to unauthorized parties), Privacy (private data disclosed without consent), Integrity (data modified without authorization), and Availability (authorized data or resources made available when requested).

📝 Note:
Place all technical and operational security controls here (3.3.2). Use 3.4 for regulatory or contractual obligations and audit evidence, 3.1 for interface-level validation and secure communication protocols, and 3.6 for AI/ML-specific runtime protections and data governance requirements, while cross-referencing concrete controls in this section.
